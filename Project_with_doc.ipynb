    "#### **Project description and details:**\n",
    "The project is structured around five distinct modules, each tailored to a specific aspect of the Thymio Robot's navigation and operational capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Vision Module: \n",
    "This component is responsible for capturing and processing visual data, primarily for map generation and the robot's localization within the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Global Navigation Module: \n",
    "It focuses on plotting a global path for the robot. This is achieved through the implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm on a visibility graph, enabling the robot to plan its route from its current position to the designated goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Local Navigation Module: \n",
    "This module is designed for real-time navigation, particularly in dealing with immediate obstacles. It facilitates local obstacle avoidance and dynamically adjusts the robot's path as new obstacles are detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Filtering Module: \n",
    "The core function of this module is continuous state estimation, primarily achieved through the use of an Extended Kalman Filter. This ensures that the robot has an accurate understanding of its state in relation to the environment, even when the camera is unable to capture visual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Control Law Module: \n",
    "This final module governs the robot's movement and behavior. It includes algorithms for path following and control laws to ensure that the robot adheres to the planned path, and it responds appropriately to changes in the environment, such as being moved unexpectedly (kidnapping detection) or encountering unforeseen obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses mainly the camelCase naming convention for variables and functions (everything except the kalman filter). For the kalman filter, the snake case convention was used. This was because of the ditribution of the work among the team members.\n",

    "In the development of our Mobile Robotics Project, we employed a forward-thinking strategy by incorporating ChatGPT-4's capabilities. Our choice was influenced by ChatGPT-4's sophisticated computational prowess and its adeptness in crafting intricate geometric figures. We primarily utilized the model to construct a variety of polygons, which functioned as fixed obstacles on our map. We observed that while the model could produce a broad spectrum of shapes, from simple triangles to elaborate polygons, it encountered difficulties in creating a PDF with non-overlapping shapes. Additionally, it was challenged in randomly generating polygons, often resulting in blank outputs or error messages. Consequently, we intervened by specifying the dimensions, forms, and hues of the polygons. As a result, our map was not entirely AI-generated but rather a collaborative effort, blending our specific polygon choices with GPT-4's assembly skills. This experience once again underscored the limitations of a Large Language Model (LLM) in tasks demanding significant creativity.\n",

We started the development with the USB camera, but while experimenting with the camer choice we discovered that using a macbook, the camera of the iphone with the same icloud account is automatically recognized as a webcam wirelessly. This was great considering the camera had to be placed in the roof pointing down at the table. This allowed us to stick the phone to the roof and not have any cables hanging from the roof to the computer. From python, the camera is recognized as a normal webcam, so the code did not have to be changed.\n",

    "The computer vision module maps the environment to a 2d plane, to allow for correct functioning of the following modules. To do this, four small green markers are placed on the corners of the table. The camera detects the markers (the global obstacles are also green so the external 4 green detected objects are taken) and maps these point to certain point on the plane depending on the aspect ratio of the markers.\n",

The mask is a composed of a white background and two red rectangles, one large in the back (center between the two wheels, important since this is the center of rotation) and one small in the front. Two rectangles are used to be able to discriminate the angle from 0 to 2pi instead of 0 to pi. This method gives us the robot's position and orientation.\n",

    "For the global navigation, we used the visibility graph algorithm. To do this we used the library pyvisgraph. The library has all the functions needed including the finding of the shortest path, so no extra libraries (apart from the already used numpy and matplotlib) were needed. It is important to note that the library uses a different coordinate standard than openCV, so an extra function was needed to convert the coordinates. Another important addition was the pushing far of the point in the edge. When initially testing the system we encountered issues when a global obstacle was close to the edge even if expanded for the robot size. To resolve this we pushed the points of the global obstacles that are on the edge to a distance far away from the center. This ensured that the path planning algorithm would not consider them."

Depending on in which side the obstacle is detected, the robot will turn in the opposite direction and avoid the obstacle using a squared path manouver. The moving of the robot was done using a direct speed input and timers, since it proved to be simple but effective. The values of the timers were found by trial and error. Even if considerably precise, at the end of the manouver and once the obstacle has been avoided, the global path planning algorithm is run again to ensure the continuation is smooth and the robot recovers in th ebest possible manner.  This method has some limitations though. The aproximated size of the obstacles has to be known a priori and sufficient place to do the manouver has to be available."

    "#### **Why Kalman?**\n",
    "\n",
    "During the course we have encountered different Bayes filter to estimate the state of a robot in a given environment. For example, we could have used a particle filter, but it is more computationally expensive and it is not necessary for this application. For our task we have choosen the Kalman filter, a recursive filter that estimates the state of a system from a series of noisy measurements. It is a very efficient algorithm that can be used to solve the localization problem of a robot, but has a crucial assumption about the distribution of the noise. In fact, it assumes that the noise is Gaussian distributed, which is not always the case in real life. However, in differential robots, like the Thymio, odometry is primarily based on the velocity sensors of the motors to calculate the robot's position and orientation ($x, y, \\gamma$). The errors in odometry can arise from various sources:\n",
    "- Sensor Measurement Errors: The sensors might not be perfectly accurate or might exhibit some drift over time.\n",
    "- Mechanical Misalignments: Slight imperfections in the robot's construction or wear in components can cause discrepancies.\n",
    "- Differential Motion Transmission Variances: Factors like friction, tire pressure, or differences in the movement surface can affect how motion is transmitted from the motors to the wheels.\n",
    "- Slippage Error: The wheels may slip or lose traction, leading to inaccurate distance measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each of these error sources contributes small, independent increments to the overall odometry error. According to the Central Limit Theorem, when a large number of small, independent effects are summed, their overall distribution tends to approach a Gaussian distribution. This implies that even if each individual source of error might not be Gaussian, their cumulative effect tends towards a normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the odometry noise can be assumed to be Gaussian distributed, the Kalman filter, that's easy to implement, is a good choice for our application.\n",
